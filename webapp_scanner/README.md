Simple wrapper around nmap, ffuf and nuclei. Designed to automate most of the basic scans on a CTF/Web pentest.

Dependencies:
1. nmap
2. ffuf
3. nuclei
4. Possibly seclists

In order to run it, a simple config file is needed (mostly for ffuf things like: method, wordlist, flags etc.), currently the hardcoded path is `~/.local/scanner_config.json`
`./scanner.py print-config`

TODO
1. Add options for nmap and nuclei in the config
2. Maybe add more tools
3. Add a flag to skip interactive prompts
4. Integrate with pentest.ws
